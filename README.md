# HealthNotifier

The application sends a notification at a random time so your day not ends like that:

Simply press the 'Start' button and the application will pop up in a random time and play a sound (min and max values are set in the input fields).

<i><sub><sup>I tested the application by myself. It really helps!</sup></sub></i>
